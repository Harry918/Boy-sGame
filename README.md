A multiplayer online game that allows friends to answer interesting questions about each other. The idea came about when my friends and I were bored during the COVID pandemic, and we needed a game to keep us occupied. I decided to take the lead and build this app using a Node.js backend, and a React.js frontend. Socket.io was also used to connect multiple players in a room, and Express.js was the framework for connecting all the respective parts of the app. The app is currently in the beta testing phase, where I am tweaking all the minor bugs and UI complications. Node.js backend is actively running on an AWS EC2 instance.
