/*  ID is the question number. FIRST is the first part of the question
    before a name will be inserted. SECOND is the remaining part. 

    For example:
    {id: 3, first: "What is ", second: "'s favorite food?"},

    On screen it would display: What is Parshva's favorite food?

    @Important: notice the spacing in first and second. Gear the spacing
    according to the question. Also notice the comma at the end. Add
    it please.
